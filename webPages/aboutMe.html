                <h2 class ="aboutMeSpacing">My Experience</h2>

                <p>I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2020 with a Bachelor's of Science in Geoscience.
                    During my time there, I worked in a lab with my professor as a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) Specialist, 
                    using software to map stonewalls all around New England. This experience and the research that came with 
                    it helped me land a role during my senior year as the GIS Specialist for the UCONN IT Department. During my time 
                    there, I learned a lot about the IT environment and how professional tech work is carried out. 
                    I enjoyed working on my senior capstone project, and thanks to coaching from my amazing professor and grad student mentor I won
                    the UCONN Department of Geosciences 2020 Undergrad Research Award. During my final semester I absolutely knew 
                    that I wanted to get a job in GIS working with computers. 
                </p>
                   
                <p>My class of 2020 graduated to a world in chaos, and, like many of my classmates, I took the first job I could get out 
                   of college. Since then, I've had experiences working in fields that gave me exposure to 
                   different walks of life. I've worked as a Construction Inspector, a Construction Superintendent Trainee, and my latest job has been as an 
                   Administrative Coordinator at a ski area in Vermont. 
                </p>

                <p>I wanted to get back to my GIS roots. Even though I had plenty of experience in college, I was having trouble landing a job in that 
                    field because of my lack of coding skills, which any full Computer Science or GIS major would have. So, I enrolled
                    in an online coding platform, Scrimba, and took courses on Python, the most prominent language used for GIS software. 
                    Then, I became hooked on a new course offering, the Frontend Developer Career Path course. 
                </p>

                <p>At the same time, I learned basic Wordpress skills as my job at the ski area. I updated information on the website, such as descriptions for certain pages, 
                    created ads for local businesses, and created new web pages. The more I learned about Wordpress the more fascinating it became. The combination of
                    working with Wordpress and taking Scrimba's Frontend Developer course made me realize I really wanted to get into Web Design
                    and development. I am currently learning the web application framework Ruby on Rails and would like to be a fullstack developer one day.
                </p>

                <p>On a more personal note, I currently live in the beautiful state of Vermont. I have started taken up photography as a hobby; every
                    image on this website was taken by yours truly. Check out my Photography section for more!

    may wish to create, but don't have the software skills to make it happen. Since I am fairly "new to the game", I can offer you more 
    afforable prices compared to professionals that have spent years in the field. While my websites or code may not be as advanced as theirs, 
    I seek to provide you a good looking product that is effective and checks all the boxes for what you really need it to be.
