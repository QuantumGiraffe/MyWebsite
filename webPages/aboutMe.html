                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <!-- <p>My strengths are the three main front-end development languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                </p> -->

                <p>I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2020 with a Bachelor's of Science in Geoscience.
                During my time there, I worked in a lab with my professor as a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) Specialist, 
                using software to map stonewalls all around New England. This experience and the research that came with 
                it helped me land a role senior year as the GIS Specialist for the UCONN IT Department. During my time 
                there, I learned a lot about the IT environment and how professional tech work is carried out. 
                I had so much fun working on my senior capstone project, and thanks to my amazing professor and grad student mentor I won
                the UCONN Department of Geosciences 2020 Undergrad Research Award. During my final semester I absolutely knew 
                that I wanted to get a job in GIS working with computers.  </p>
                   
                <p> We all remember how times were right at the beginning of the pandemic. My class of 2020 graduated to a world in chaos, 
                   and I like many of my classmates took the first jobs we could get out of college. Since then, I've moved twice and had some great 
                   experiences working in fields that gave me great exposure to all different walks of life. I've worked as a 
                   Construction Inspector, a Construction Superintendent Trainee, and my latest job has been as an 
                   Administrative Coordinator at Mad River Glen Cooperative Ski Area in Vermont. </p>

                <p>I wanted to get back to my roots in college and get back into the field of GIS. I realized that even though I 
                    had plenty of experience in college, I was having trouble landing a job in that field because of my lack of 
                    coding skills, as any full Computer Science of GIS major would have. This was something I needed to change. I enrolled
                    in an online coding platform, Scrimba. I took courses on Python, the most prominent language used for GIS software. 
                    Soon, a new course appeared on Scrimba: the Front-End Developer Career Path course. Once I started, I became hooked.
                </p>

                <p>At the same time this was happening, I began learning on how to use Wordpress at my job at Mad River Glen. I would 
                    work with the managers to update information on the website, such as descriptions for certain pages, creating ads
                    for local businesses, and creating new web pages. The more I learned about Wordpress the more fascinating to me it became. Between the combination of
                    working with Wordpress and taking Scrimba's Front-End Developer course, that I realized I really wanted to get into Web Design
                    and Front-End Development.
                </p>

                <p>Now, I am seeking work as Front-End Developer! I would love to help you make a website, or help develop/work on any projects you
                   may wish to create, but don't have the software skills to make it happen. Since I am fairly "new to the game", I can offer you more 
                   afforable prices compared to professionals that have spent years in the field. While my websites or code may not be as advanced as theirs, 
                   I seek to provide you a good looking product that is effective and checks all the boxes for what you really need it to be. 
                </p>

                <p> On a more personal note, I currently live in the beautiful state of Vermont. I have started taking up photography as a hobby; every
                    image on this website was taken by yours truly. Check out my Photography section for more!
